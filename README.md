# Predicting NYC Traffic

Traffic and congestion on New York City Streets is a real and present problem. I want to create a model that can predict not only if a street will have traffic but at what speed the traffic is travelling at. If crashes do occur, the slower a vehicle is moving, the likelihood of it being a fatal crash decreases. It is in the interest of the safety of the public for the city to be able to properly manage and predict the speeds at which vehicles are moving on its streets.

This exploration will connect real time traffic data, with the general features of each street. I will then set up supervised and unsupervised learning methods, as well as a CNN, to predict both a regression and a categorical speed variable.
